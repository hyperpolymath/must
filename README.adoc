= must: The Authority-First State Orchestrator
:author: Hyperpolymath
:revnumber: 0.1.0-Alpha
:toc: macro

Status: Alpha | Tooling: Ada 2022 (GNAT) | Build: must-just-nickel

== Overview
`must` is a high-assurance deployment engine designed to enforce a **Contract of Physical State**. It consumes `mustfile.ncl` (Nickel) manifests to orchestrate transitions across Linux, Minix, macOS, iOS, Android, and PC environments.

== Core Principles
* **Physical State:** Verifiable enforcement of `must_have` and `must_not_have` file states.
* **Security-First:** Built-in support for ML-KEM-1024 (Kyber) and ML-DSA-87 (Dilithium5) via the Mustfile spec.
* **Nickel-Augmented:** Type-safe, formally verifiable configuration logic.

== Installation
To maintain build integrity, `must` is built using itself (bootstrapped via `just`).

[source,bash]
----
# Ensure just and nickel are installed
just install-deps
just build
----

== Deployment
Primary deployment is **Podman-first**. 
[source,bash]
----
must deploy --target podman
----

== Shell Support


== Documentation
* `man must`: Comprehensive CLI documentation.
* `cookbook.adoc`: All build recipes (generated by must-just-nickel).
